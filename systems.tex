\begin{frame}{Macroeconomic Goals}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item “Internal balance” describes the macroeconomic goals of
		producing at \structure{potential output} (at “full employment”) and of \structure{price stability} (low inflation).
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An unsustainable use of resources (overemployment) tends to		increase prices; an ineffective use of resources
			(underemployment) tends to decrease prices.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Volatile aggregate demand and output tend to create volatile
	prices.
			\begin{itemize}
		\item Price level movements reduce the economy’s efficiency by
		making the real value of the monetary unit less certain and thus
		a less useful guide for economic decisions.
	\end{itemize}
	\item “External balance” achieved when a current account is
				\begin{itemize}
		\item neither so deeply in deficit that the country may be unable to
		repay its foreign debts,
		\item nor so strongly in surplus that foreigners are put in that position.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For example, pressure on Japan in the 1980s and China in the 2000s.

\section{金本位制：1870-1914}
\begin{frame}{Origins of the Gold Standard}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The gold standard from 1870 to 1914 and after
		1918 had mechanisms that prevented flows of gold
		reserves (the balance of payments) from becoming
		too positive or too negative.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  Prices tended to adjust according the amount of gold
			circulating in an economy, which had effects on the flows
			of goods and services: the current account.
			\item  Central banks influenced financial asset flows, so that the
			nonreserve part of the financial account matched the
			current account in order to reduce gold outflows or
			inflows.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Price-specie-flow mechanism}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \structure{Price-specie-flow mechanism} is the adjustment
	of prices as gold (“specie”) flows into or out of a
	country, causing an adjustment in the flow of
	goods.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Prices tended to adjust according the amount of gold
		circulating in an economy, which had effects on the flows
		of goods and services: the current account.
		\item  Central banks influenced financial asset flows, so that the
		nonreserve part of the financial account matched the
		current account in order to reduce gold outflows or
		inflows.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why we think Gold Standard is a fixed exchagne rate regime}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 铸币平价：1英镑＝4.8665美元。输送黄金的额外费用约0.0292美元/英镑
		\item 本币贬值足够低，使得用本币购买外币成本过高，而将本币变成黄金输出到外国再改铸成外币的成本更低，则出现本国黄金输出点(对外国为输入点）。
		\item 反之，当本币升值足够高，使得用外币购买本币过高，而将外币变成黄金输入到本国再改铸成本币的成本更低，则出现本国黄金输入点（对外国为输出点）。
	\end{itemize}
		\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig/systems/specie}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The “Rules of the Game” under the gold standard}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In theory, the price-specie-flow mechanism could operate automatically. But the
	reactions of central banks to gold flows across their borders furnished another
	potential mechanism to help restore balance of payments equilibrium. 
	\item The \structure{“Rules of the Game”} under the gold standard
	refer to another adjustment process that was
	theoretically carried out by central banks
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The selling of domestic assets to acquire money when gold
		exited the country as payments for imports.减少黄金流出
		\item The buying of domestic assets when gold enters the
		country as income from exports. 减少黄金流入

\begin{columns}[onlytextwidth]
	\begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
		\begin{itemize}
		
				\item The gold standard’s record for internal balance was
				mixed.
			\begin{itemize}
			\item The U.S. suffered from deflation, recessions, and financial
			instability during the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s while
			trying to adhere to a gold standard.
			\item The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.8\% on average from
			1890 to 1913, but it was less than 5.7\% on average from
			1946 to 1992.

	\item 汇率稳定，促进全球贸易、世界经济发展
	\item 世界能否重回金本位时代？
	\item 黄金是否还是货币？
	\item 黄金能否重拾货币荣耀？
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 恢复金平价？有黄金虫(gold bug)倡导，但不可能
			\item 黄金产量有限
			\item 货币需求量太大

\section{两次世界大战期间：1918-1939}
\begin{frame}{The Fleeting Return to Gold}
		\begin{itemize}
	\item The gold standard was stopped in 1914 due to war,
	but after 1918 it was attempted again
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The U.S. reinstated the gold standard from 1919 to 1933
		at \$20.67 per ounce and from 1934 to 1944 at \$35.00 per
		ounce (a devaluation of the dollar).
		\item The U.K. reinstated the gold standard from 1925 to 1931.
	\end{itemize}
	\item But countries that adhered to the gold standard for
	the longest time, without devaluing their
	currencies, suffered most from reduced output and
	employment during the 1930s.

\begin{frame}{44 countries meeting in Bretton Woods}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In July 1944, 44 countries met in Bretton Woods,

		\begin{itemize}
			\item a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and a fixed
			dollar price of gold (\$35 per ounce).

\begin{frame}{Goals and Structure of the IMF}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a mixture of discipline and flexibility原则性+灵活性
		\item Discipline
			\begin{itemize}
				\item exchange
				rates be fixed to the dollar, which, in turn, was tied to gold
				\item floating exchange rates were a cause of speculative
				instability and were harmful to international trade.
				
			\end{itemize}
		\item Flexibility
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Loans were made from a fund paid for by members in gold
				and currencies.
				\item Each country had a quota, which determined its
				contribution to the fund and the maximum amount it could
				borrow.
				\item Large loans were made conditional on the supervision of
				domestic policies by the IMF: IMF conditionality.
				\item Devaluations could occur if the IMF determined that the				economy was experiencing a “fundamental
				disequilibrium.”

\begin{frame}{Convertibility and the Expansion of Private Financial Flows}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \structure{convertible currency} is one that may be freely exchanged for foreign		currencies.
		\item The U.S. and Canadian dollars became convertible in 1945
		\item Because dollars were freely convertible, it became an
		international money.
		\item central banks had
		to be attentive to foreign financial conditions or take the risk that sudden reserve losses
		might leave them without the resources needed to peg exchange rates.

\begin{frame}{Speculative Capital Flows and Crises}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Current account deficits and surpluses took on added significance under the new
	conditions of increasingly mobile private financial flows.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A country with a large
		and persistent current account deficit——fundamental disequilibrium——Suspicion of an impending devaluation—— balance of
		payments crisis
		\item countries with large current account surpluses——Propensity of avaluation—— selling the home currency in the
		foreign exchange market to keep the currency from appreciating——money supply grow uncontrollably——内部失衡
	\end{itemize}
	\item 	A record British trade balance deficit in early
	1964 led to a period of intermittent speculation against the pound 
	\item France devalued its franc and Germany revalued its mark in 1969 after similar speculative attacks

		\item Maintaining Internal Balance
		$Y^{f} = C + I + G + CA(EP^{*}/P, A) = A + CA(EP^{*}/P, A)$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An increase in government purchases (or a
			decrease in taxes) increases aggregate demand
			and output above its full employment level.
			\item To restore internal balance in the short run, a
			revaluation (a fall in E) must occur.

		\item the Mckinnon global monetary target proposal
				\begin{itemize}
			\item Ronald McKinnon (1982, 1984) has argued that much exchange rate volatility is

			\item  the Friedman rule for smooth monetary growth should be shifted

		\item the tobin foreign exchange tax proposal
				\begin{itemize}
			\item James Tobin (1978) has argued that much of the disruptive exchange rate movements

		\item Tobin suggests that a tax be imposed on all foreign exchange transactions ‘to throw some sand in the wheels of our excessively efficient international		money markets’ . 
		\item  criticisms
		\begin{itemize}
			\item not all short-term capital movements are undesirable, and the tax would prevent
			some stabilizing movements.
			\item with today’s
			modern financial markets it is likely that the tax would be easily circumvented as
			financial innovation would lead to a replication of speculative positions through
			synthetic instruments that were unaffected by the tax.
			\item Government tend to abuse this national monetary autonomy
